 Users can create a profile and connect with other profiles anonymously. Users will be able to log in, upload a profile picture, and maintain a list of other users they have connected with.

VISION STATEMENT:
A social network which places its emphasis on anonymity. Users are free to connect with others as themselves or as an anonymous person. With the increasing amount of connection and sharing on social networks, a social network which lets you connect when you want to, and respects your privacy when you don't--a truly unique concept.
