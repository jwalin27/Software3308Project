TITLE:
Anonymous

DESCRIPTION:
 Users can create a profile and connect with other profiles anonymously. Users will be able to log in, upload a profile picture, and maintain a list of other users they have connected with.

VISION STATEMENT:
A social network which places its emphasis on anonymity. Users are free to connect with others as themselves or as an anonymous person. With the increasing amount of connection and sharing on social networks, a social network which lets you connect when you want to, and respects your privacy when you don't--a truly unique concept.


MOTIVATION:
With the burgeoning popularity of social networks, we feel it is important to have a basic understanding of how they work from a programmer's perspective. Developing this will help us to achieve this understanding, as we utilize industry tools to accomplish our goal.

RISKS:
New environments and tools like github, slack, trello, and editing software
Lack of experience with SQL or other database tools
Limited time of the class to complete project
-MITIGATION
Because we are students, we are often required to learn new tools and languages, and so we will use our learning strategies to overcome these knowledge barriers.
Constant focus and effort will be required to get our project to an acceptable level before the end of the course, but the acknowlegement of this will help us to work efficiently and as a team.
