Organization of repo:
All HTML and PHP files required to run are located in the 'Mask' folder
Assets of this code are stored in nested folders within 'Mask'
These assets are sorted into a 'css' folder, a 'js' folder (javascript), and two separate 'fonts' folders.
Our autodocumenter is stored in the main directory, just above the Mask directory.
