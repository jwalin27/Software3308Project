VISION STATEMENT:


MOTIVATION:
With the burgeoning popularity of social networks, we feel it is important to have a basic understanding of how they work from a programmer's perspective. Developing this will help us to achieve this understanding, as we utilize industry tools to accomplish our goal.

RISKS:
New environments and tools like github, slack, trello, and editing software
Lack of experience with SQL or other database tools
Limited time of the class to complete project
-MITIGATION
Because we are students, we are often required to learn new tools and languages, and so we will use our learning strategies to overcome these knowledge barriers.
Constant focus and effort will be required to get our project to an acceptable level before the end of the course, but the acknowlegement of this will help us to work efficiently and as a team.
